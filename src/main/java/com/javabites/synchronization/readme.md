Thread synchronization is handled by the concept of Intrinsic lock or monitor(called mutex too). When a thread acquires a lock on the object no other thread is allowed until the current thread completes it's job.
Thread synchronization ensures that the operation/update makes reliable when multiple threads act or work upon a shared object simultaneously or at the same time.
